## Step 0-3 Summary (2025-08-15)
- Added repo guardrails (.copilot-instructions.md), VS Code settings, and chem-env.yaml for conda/mamba environment.
- Updated README with install instructions and Makefile to default to python3 and run FastAPI app via uvicorn.
- Created backend app wiring (FastAPI) and common schema helpers (ok/fail) in iam/backend/app.py and iam/backend/schemas/common.py.

## Part B / Step 1 (2025-08-15)
- Added FastAPI app wiring and included routers for xtb, psi4, empirical, cj.
- Implemented shared schema helpers (ok/fail) and ComputeRequest model.
- Created compute route stubs for /compute/xtb, /compute/psi4, /compute/empirical, /compute/cj, all returning normalized schema.
- Updated Makefile to run uvicorn for FastAPI app.
- Added pytest smoke tests for all compute endpoints.
- Documented endpoints and schema in docs/API.md.

## Part B / Step 2 (2025-08-15)
- Added empirical predictor stubs for Kamlet–Jacobs and Keshavarz methods with deterministic outputs.
- Implemented predict_empirical interface to select method.
- Wired /compute/empirical route to use empirical predictor.
- Added unit tests for empirical predictor and route.

## Part B / Step 3 (2025-08-15)
- Added CJ predictor stub with input validation in iam/runners/cantera_cj.py
- Wired /compute/cj route to CJ stub and normalized response
- Added pytest tests for CJ stub (good and bad inputs)
- Documented /compute/cj endpoint and schema in API.md

## Part B / Step 4A (2025-08-15)
- Added persistence utilities for saving results as JSON and appending benchmark CSV.
- Updated empirical and CJ routes to persist results on success.
- Added pytest tests for persistence utilities.

## Step 4B / Environment & Test Finalization (2025-08-15)
- Configured `iam2` conda environment to auto-activate via ~/.bashrc for all new terminal sessions.
- Verified all tests pass in the correct environment (`iam2`).
- Updated CJ route to raise HTTPException for input validation errors, ensuring FastAPI returns 422 for all invalid payloads.
- All Ketcher and convert routes are implemented, tested, and working as expected.
- Project is now robust to environment setup and input validation errors.

## Repo Reorganization (2025-08-15)
- Moved files and created missing __init__.py files to match blueprint structure.
- Updated README.md with repository layout section.
- Miniconda installer moved to installers/ (not tracked due to .gitignore).
- All imports and test paths to be updated in next step.

## Step 5 — ZIP Export Endpoint (2025-08-15)
- Implemented POST /export/zip in iam/backend/routes/export.py with safe path validation and artifact bundling.
- Wired export router into FastAPI app.
- Added pytest tests for successful zip creation and path traversal rejection (tests/api/test_export.py).
- All export endpoint tests pass.

## Step 6 — Examples/Requests Added (2025-08-15)
- Created examples/requests/ with .http files for convert, ketcher_to_smiles, ketcher_to_xyz, and ketcher_run endpoints.
- Added examples/README.md with usage instructions for VS Code REST Client and curl.
- All examples use a small V2000 molfile for methane inline.
