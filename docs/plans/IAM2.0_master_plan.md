# IAM2.0 Migration Master Plan

## 🎯 Executive Overview

This document consolidates all IAM→IAM2.0 migration documentation and provides navigable links to all project components. The migration transforms the Flask-based IAM chemistry platform to IAM2.0 using the FastAPI-based nox backend.

## 📁 Documentation Structure

### Plans & Strategy
- [Migration Strategy](./MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md) - High-level approach and phases
- [UI Migration Plan](./UI_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) - Frontend component migration
- [API Endpoint Migration](./API_ENDPOINT_MIGRATION.md) - Flask→FastAPI endpoint mapping
- [Risk Register](./RISK_REGISTER.md) - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- [TODO Execution List](./TODO_IAM2.0.md) - Prioritized implementation tasks

### Technical Reports
- [Technical Inventory API](../reports/TECHNICAL_INVENTORY_API.md) - Complete API endpoint catalog
- [Technical Inventory Database](../reports/TECHNICAL_INVENTORY_DATABASE.md) - Database models analysis  
- [Technical Inventory Chemistry](../reports/TECHNICAL_INVENTORY_CHEMISTRY.md) - RDKit/XTB/Psi4 capabilities
- [Technical Inventory Files](../reports/TECHNICAL_INVENTORY_FILES.md) - File I/O operations mapping
- [Technical Inventory Deployment](../reports/TECHNICAL_INVENTORY_DEPLOYMENT.md) - Infrastructure configuration

### Interface Specifications
- [Ketcher PostMessage Contract](../specs/KETCHER_POSTMESSAGE_CONTRACT.md) - Frontend-backend communication protocol
- [Environment Requirements](../specs/ENV_REQUIREMENTS_UNIFIED.md) - Complete dependency specification

### Testing Framework
- [Test Plan](../tests/TESTPLAN_IAM2.0.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy
- [API Tests](../../tests/api/) - Endpoint validation tests
- [Chemistry Tests](../../tests/chem/) - Computational regression tests
- [UI Contract Tests](../../tests/ui_contracts/) - Frontend integration tests

## 🔄 Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
✅ Documentation structure created  
✅ Technical inventory completed  
✅ Risk assessment documented  
✅ Testing framework designed  

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (In Progress)
🔄 Pytest scaffold setup  
🔄 Ketcher bundle integration  
🔄 RDKit converter implementation  
🔄 API endpoint wiring  

### Phase 3: Infrastructure
⏳ CI/CD pipeline setup  
⏳ Docker development environment  
⏳ Environment configuration lock  
⏳ Logging and monitoring  

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
⏳ Job runner implementation  
⏳ Performance prediction endpoints  
⏳ UX polish and integration  
⏳ Production deployment
