## Step 0-3 Summary (2025-08-15)
- Added repo guardrails (.copilot-instructions.md), VS Code settings, and chem-env.yaml for conda/mamba environment.
- Updated README with install instructions and Makefile to default to python3 and run FastAPI app via uvicorn.
- Created backend app wiring (FastAPI) and common schema helpers (ok/fail) in iam/backend/app.py and iam/backend/schemas/common.py.

## Part B / Step 1 (2025-08-15)
- Added FastAPI app wiring and included routers for xtb, psi4, empirical, cj.
- Implemented shared schema helpers (ok/fail) and ComputeRequest model.
- Created compute route stubs for /compute/xtb, /compute/psi4, /compute/empirical, /compute/cj, all returning normalized schema.
- Updated Makefile to run uvicorn for FastAPI app.
- Added pytest smoke tests for all compute endpoints.
- Documented endpoints and schema in docs/API.md.

## Part B / Step 2 (2025-08-15)
- Added empirical predictor stubs for Kamlet–Jacobs and Keshavarz methods with deterministic outputs.
- Implemented predict_empirical interface to select method.
- Wired /compute/empirical route to use empirical predictor.
- Added unit tests for empirical predictor and route.

## Part B / Step 3 (2025-08-15)
- Added CJ predictor stub with input validation in iam/runners/cantera_cj.py
- Wired /compute/cj route to CJ stub and normalized response
- Added pytest tests for CJ stub (good and bad inputs)
- Documented /compute/cj endpoint and schema in API.md

## Part B / Step 4A (2025-08-15)
- Added persistence utilities for saving results as JSON and appending benchmark CSV.
- Updated empirical and CJ routes to persist results on success.
- Added pytest tests for persistence utilities.

## Step 4B / Environment & Test Finalization (2025-08-15)
- Configured `iam2` conda environment to auto-activate via ~/.bashrc for all new terminal sessions.
- Verified all tests pass in the correct environment (`iam2`).
- Updated CJ route to raise HTTPException for input validation errors, ensuring FastAPI returns 422 for all invalid payloads.
- All Ketcher and convert routes are implemented, tested, and working as expected.
- Project is now robust to environment setup and input validation errors.

## Repo Reorganization (2025-08-15)
- Moved files and created missing __init__.py files to match blueprint structure.
- Updated README.md with repository layout section.
- Miniconda installer moved to installers/ (not tracked due to .gitignore).
- All imports and test paths to be updated in next step.

## Step 5 — ZIP Export Endpoint (2025-08-15)
- Implemented POST /export/zip in iam/backend/routes/export.py with safe path validation and artifact bundling.
- Wired export router into FastAPI app.
- Added pytest tests for successful zip creation and path traversal rejection (tests/api/test_export.py).

## Step 7 — Env-aware Persistence Utilities & Route Wiring (2025-08-15)
- Updated persistence utilities in iam/backend/utils/persistence.py to respect IAM_RESULTS_BASE env var and ensure Results/Exports subdirs exist.
- Wired persistence into convert, ketcher run, empirical, and cj routes: only persist on ok=True, and append benchmark rows with Pcj/Tcj/VoD if present.
- Persistence logic now supports clean testing and success-only writes.

## Step 8 — OpenAPI v1 Spec & Endpoint (2025-08-15)
## Step 9 — Error Normalization & Envelope (2025-08-15)
- Refactored all backend routes to return errors using a normalized error envelope:
	```json
	{
		"code": 400,
		"message": "Invalid input",
		"details": {},
		"correlation_id": "uuid"
	}
	```
- Updated fail() helper to delegate to error_envelope, ensuring all errors are wrapped and include a correlation_id.
- All error responses now use appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 429, 500, etc.).
- Updated conformance tests to expect correct status codes and validate error envelope shape for error cases.
- All tests pass; contract compliance is maintained.
- Documented error envelope and error handling in docs/API.md and added examples for invalid input, file not found, and quota exceeded.

## Step 10 — NOX OpenAPI Spec Integration (2025-08-15)
- Synced IAM-2.0 OpenAPI spec with NOX integration version.
- Added endpoints: /compute/xtb, /compute/psi4, /compute/empirical, /compute/cj.
- Refactored all request schemas to named components (ConvertMolfileRequest, KetcherToXYZRequest, etc.) for clarity and contract alignment.
- Updated endpoint descriptions and enums to match NOX spec.
- Updated docs/API.md to reflect new endpoints and schemas, including request/response examples.
- All changes maintain normalized response and error envelope contract.

## Step 11 — OpenAPI v1 Spec Polish & Validation (2025-08-15)
- Reviewed and polished openapi/iam2.v1.yaml for endpoint coverage and schema clarity.
- Validated spec using scripts/validate_openapi.py; result: spec is valid and contract-compliant.
- All endpoints and schemas match NOX requirements.
- Ready for NOX SDK generation and contract tests.

## Step 12 — Envelope Conformance Testing ✅ (2025-08-15)
**Objective:** Comprehensive testing of error envelope conformance across all scenarios

**Implementation:**
- Created `tests/api/test_envelope_edge_cases.py` with 15 comprehensive test cases

  - Missing required fields returning HTTP 422  
  - Empty string validation returning HTTP 400
  - Invalid methods returning HTTP 501
  - Invalid stoichiometry parameters returning HTTP 422
- **Success scenarios tested:**  
  - All endpoints returning proper envelope shapes with correlation_id
